# Solution

## Select approach

After exploring the content of the target page at Aptoide and specifically the page for the app at [Infinite Magicraid](https://infinite-magicraid.en.aptoide.com/app), it is evident that the main content of the page is rendered server-side and is not dynamically generated on the client side. This design allows the page to be loaded and its content parsed using simple HTTP requests and HTML parsing libraries. However, to access the latest version of the application, it's necessary to navigate to the 'Versions' tab, which loads the versions' content dynamically. Upon examining the network traffic, it is observed that the content is loaded from the '/versions' endpoint and can be accessed using the following URL: https://infinite-magicraid.en.aptoide.com/versions. The content of this page is also rendered on the server and is relatively static, so a simple HTTP request can be used to fetch the page content, which can then be parsed using an HTML parsing library as well.

Libraries available for scraping web pages in Python include:

- [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
- [lxml](https://lxml.de/)
- [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
- [Requests-HTML](https://requests.readthedocs.io/projects/requests-html/en/latest/)
- [MechanicalSoup](https://mechanicalsoup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Pyppeteer](https://miyakogi.github.io/pyppeteer/)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/)

After some research, it is decided to use a combination of BeatifulSoup and LXML to scrape the target page. The reasons for this decision are:

- The target page is relatively simple and does not require a full-fledged web scraping framework like Scrapy.
- The target page is not rendered dynamically on the client side, so there is no need to use a browser automation library like Selenium, Pyppeteer or Playwright.
- The target page is not rendered using JavaScript, so there is no need to use a library like Requests-HTML, MechanicalSoup or Playwright.

## Scraping the page

To scrape the target page we will use the BeautifulSoup library. It is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. To extract data from a web page we need to follow these steps:

### Download the web page using the requests library.

```python
def fetch_page_content(url: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Fetch the content of a webpage

    Args:
        url (str): URL of the webpage

    Returns:
        Optional[str]: Content of the webpage if successful, None otherwise
    """

    try:
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.content.decode("utf-8")
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Error fetching page content: {e}")
        return None
    except UnicodeDecodeError as e:
        logging.error(f"Error decoding content from {url}: {e}")
        return None
```

### Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup or lxml.

```python
def scrape_target_page(url: str) -> Optional[dict]:
    """Scrape the target page

    Args:
        url (str): URL of the target page
    """
    base_url = convert_to_base_url(url)
    content = fetch_page_content(base_url)
    if not content:
        return None

    tree = html.fromstring(content)
    return {
        "app_url": base_url,
        "app_name": scrape_app_name(tree),
        "no_downloads": scrape_no_downloads(tree),
        "app_description": scrape_app_description(tree),
        "app_release_date": scrape_app_release_date(tree),
        "app_version": scrape_app_version(base_url),
    }
```

### Extract the data from the parsed HTML content using CSS selectors or XPath expressions.

```python
def scrape_element(tree: html, xpath: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Scrape an element from a webpage by its XPath

    Args:
        tree (html): HTML tree of the webpage
        xpath (str): XPath of the element to scrape

    Returns:
        Optional[str]: Text content of the element if found, None otherwise
    """

    element = tree.xpath(xpath)
    return element[0].text if element else None
```

## Scraping via API

For the better user experience the scraping logic was wrapped into API server that allows to scrape the target page via HTTP requests. The API server is implemented using the Falcon framework. Faclon is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. The API server is implemented in the `api/main.py` file.

### Syncronous API

The `/v1/scrape` endpoint of the API server implements the synchronous version of the scraping logic. It accepts a single URL parameter `target_url` and returns the scraped data in JSON format. 

The advantage of this approach is that it is simple and easy to implement. However, it has the following drawbacks:

* It is not scalable. The API server can only handle one request at a time.
* It is not fast. The API server will block until the scraping logic completes.

### Asyncronous API

The `/v2/scrape` endpoint of the API server implements the asynchronous version of the scraping logic. It accepts a single URL parameter `target_url` and returns the status and task id of the background task in JSON format. The task id can be used to query the status of the background task using the `/v2/scrape/result/{task_id}` endpoint. 

The advantages if asyncronous API are:

* It is scalable. The API server can handle multiple requests at a time.
* It is fast. The API server will not block until the scraping logic completes.
 
### Server Side Events

To extend the asyncronous API with the ability to stream the scraping results to the client in real time, the `/v2/scrape/updates/{task_id}` endpoint of the API server implements the server side events (SSE) protocol. The scraping results are streamed to the client in real time as they are generated by the scraping logic.

## Testing

The scraping logic and all routes of the API server are covered by unit tests. The tests are implemented in the `api/tests` directory. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

## Docker Compose

To simplify the deployment of the API server, the `docker-compose.yml` file is provided. It defines the following services:

* `api` - the API server
* `redis` - the Redis server used to store the scraping results
* `tasks` - the Celery worker used to run the scraping tasks
* `mkdocs` - the MkDocs server used to serve the API documentation
* `webapp` - the web application used to showcase the use of the API server
