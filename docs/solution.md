# Solution

## Select approach

After exploring the content of the target page at Aptoide and specifically the page for the app at [Infinite Magicraid](https://infinite-magicraid.en.aptoide.com/app), it is evident that the main content of the page is rendered server-side and is not dynamically generated on the client side. This design allows the page to be loaded and its content parsed using simple HTTP requests and HTML parsing libraries. However, to access the latest version of the application, it's necessary to navigate to the 'Versions' tab, which loads the versions' content dynamically. Upon examining the network traffic, it is observed that the content is loaded from the '/versions' endpoint and can be accessed using the following URL: https://infinite-magicraid.en.aptoide.com/versions. The content of this page is also rendered on the server and is relatively static, so a simple HTTP request can be used to fetch the page content, which can then be parsed using an HTML parsing library as well.

Libraries available for scraping web pages in Python include:

- [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
- [lxml](https://lxml.de/)
- [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
- [Requests-HTML](https://requests.readthedocs.io/projects/requests-html/en/latest/)
- [MechanicalSoup](https://mechanicalsoup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Pyppeteer](https://miyakogi.github.io/pyppeteer/)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/)

After some research, it is decided to use a combination of BeatifulSoup and LXML to scrape the target page. The reasons for this decision are:

- The target page is relatively simple and does not require a full-fledged web scraping framework like Scrapy.
- The target page is not rendered dynamically on the client side, so there is no need to use a browser automation library like Selenium, Pyppeteer or Playwright.
- The target page is not rendered using JavaScript, so there is no need to use a library like Requests-HTML, MechanicalSoup or Playwright.

## Scraping the page

To scrape the target page we will use the BeautifulSoup library. It is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. To extract data from a web page we need to follow these steps:

### Download the web page using the requests library.

```python
def fetch_page_content(url: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Fetch the content of a webpage

    Args:
        url (str): URL of the webpage

    Returns:
        Optional[str]: Content of the webpage if successful, None otherwise
    """

    try:
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.content.decode("utf-8")
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Error fetching page content: {e}")
        return None
    except UnicodeDecodeError as e:
        logging.error(f"Error decoding content from {url}: {e}")
        return None
```

### Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup or lxml.

```python
def scrape_target_page(url: str) -> Optional[dict]:
    """Scrape the target page

    Args:
        url (str): URL of the target page
    """
    base_url = convert_to_base_url(url)
    content = fetch_page_content(base_url)
    if not content:
        return None

    tree = html.fromstring(content)
    return {
        "app_url": base_url,
        "app_name": scrape_app_name(tree),
        "no_downloads": scrape_no_downloads(tree),
        "app_description": scrape_app_description(tree),
        "app_release_date": scrape_app_release_date(tree),
        "app_version": scrape_app_version(base_url),
    }
```

### Extract the data from the parsed HTML content using CSS selectors or XPath expressions.

```python
def scrape_element(tree: html, xpath: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Scrape an element from a webpage by its XPath

    Args:
        tree (html): HTML tree of the webpage
        xpath (str): XPath of the element to scrape

    Returns:
        Optional[str]: Text content of the element if found, None otherwise
    """

    element = tree.xpath(xpath)
    return element[0].text if element else None
```
